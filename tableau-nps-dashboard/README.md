# Research of the survey of telecommunication company customers

## Project description

The client of this research is a large telecommunications company that provides services throughout the CIS. The company is tasked with determining the current level of customer loyalty, or NPS (Net Promoter Score), among customers who live in Russia. 

To determine the level of loyalty, customers were asked a classic question: "On a scale of 1 to 10, rate the likelihood that you would recommend the company to your friends and acquaintances".

It is necessary to preprocess the data and then prepare a Tableau dashboard with the survey results.
